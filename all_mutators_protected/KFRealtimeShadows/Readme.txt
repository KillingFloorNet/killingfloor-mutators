1) Description:
   This mutator adds real time calculated shadows to players and monsters.
   This only works if shadows are enabled (full shadows) in the main game.
   The shadows can be configured to your liking by altering the configuration file directly (which will be created after on the first run) or using the ingame interface when playing Solo (Mutators tab->Configure Mutators). Your settings will also be used when playing on servers running this mutator.


2) Installation/Deinstallation:
   Place KFRealtimeShadows.u and KFRealtimeShadows.ucl in your KillingFloor/System folder.
   To deinsall remove the above mentioned files and its respective configuration file which will be created on the first run.


3) Permissions:
   You are allowed to freely use this mutator on any servers you want. However, you're neither allowed to change the code nor use parts of it without my permission.


4) Special Thanks:
   I want to thank all of my mates that have participated in beta-testing especially Agent_Vealckowsky and brett1890.
