Husk

He will fire two consecutive shots before the cool down timer kicks in.

Only berserkers can interrupt scrake attacks with melee weapons.
Fleshpound

Breaking LOS or avoiding a frag will only pause the rage timer.

When enraged, if the fleshpound does not deal out a certain amount of damage (i.e. zerker or armored medic), he will rage again.
Added second damage accumulator that does not reset until it exceeds 1080 damage. When it does, the fleshpound rages
