ClotsDay
Simple mutator that spawns a fixed amount of clots for each clot killed.
These spawned clots do not spawn additional clots when killed.

Installation:
Drop ClotsDay.u and ClotsDay.ucl into your [Killing Floor Root]\System.
If you are thinking in starting a server, don't forget to add it to the ServerPackages in [Engine.GameEngine] section inside KillingFloor.ini.
