KFHints=("We ran about seven kilometers that night before setting up camp in a convenience store. All I could hear outside was howling and the wet slap of many feet on the pavement.","I saw one of them take a shotgun blast to the face and he still kept coming...Someone with a science degree had better study this shit.  ","The 50 cal ripped through them like a hot knife through butter..at first. They somehow found a way to circumvent the blockade and circle around. We lost Barry, and the Nest, but god...the amount of blood on the shop front windows...on the road.   ","Dave didn't make it. I couldn't even see what it was that had him because it was too dark to separate his attacker from the shadows in the alley. Almost like it *was* one of em'","They just spilled over the barbed wire...hundreds of them. The ones that got stuck would rip away their flesh to untangle themselves...","I feel as if something snapped in my head when i had to bring down one of them yesterday....a girl. She couldn't have been older than seventeen... She ran like a bat out of hell.. Gore was pouring out of her mouth. It's us or them now, ethics don't exist. I just keep telling myself that. ","It took us almost a half hour to bring down this big ugly son of a bitch that was plodding toward the Police Station. The bullets were hitting him alright, but it was difficult to say whether they were damaging him or making him a studded jacket.","We're running low on rations. Our next meal may be from the beat up local at the end of the street. We can see the Clerk roaming around just outside...howling and coughing up blood.","The Soldiers said they killed my mum because if they didn't, she would bite me. They said she would bite other people as well. She never used to do that.","By the time we arrived at the source of the radio signal, the building was empty. Someone had left a bloodstained jacket on the floor.","We don't know a whole lot about these sons of bitches. They have basic motor functionality and are resistant to gunfire. They sustain themselves by feeding on warm flesh. Everything else is speculation.","I told him reach the rest of his squad down Fourth Street .... That was an hour ago, where the fuck are they?! ","The Bullpup provides steady fire support with decent stopping power, it's going to be your mainstay out there fellas. ","They didn't notice the Frag rolling toward them, or didn't care.  The whole street was caked in entrails and burning limbs... ","This is FireTeam Delta, we have made contact with the hostiles. Tac. Recon estimates somewhere in the range of 400-500 bodies in this area.")
