Remaining money of leaving (also crashing) players will be shared among all players alive. 
Only amounts above the starting amount will be shared. 
Crashing players still lose some money as a result of dying.

Installation/Deinstallation:
Place KFShareCash.u and KFShareCash.ucl in your Killing Floor System folder.
To deinstall just remove those two files.
