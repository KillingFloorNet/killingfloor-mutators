Author: DarkStarX
Website: http://ut2k4.game-server.cc

This Mutator is totally free, you can give it to other, add it to your own Download Section,
press it on CD etc...

Whats this Mutator do?

It play random Modes and Maps, that you want, it will random all maps that are listed in the 
ini file, every mode/maps will only plays one, after all modes/maps are played, it will begin
new.
It saves too in the UserLogs dir, the current map ist playing, so when the server ist crash,
you can start with that map, but only when you use the start script that is included or write 
your own script.

You make any scripts for Windows for this Mutator?

Then post them in our forum or send them via mail to admin@softint.de
Please only scripts like batch and so on, no compiled things like exe, they will be ignored!

Instructions

Just copy the MutRandomMap.int and MutRandomMap.u to your System Folder.
When you want to use the included start and stop files (only for linux) then copy
them to a dir of your choice and edit them to your needs, they are not written by me
i only changed some things to fit to my Mutator. 

When you it, copy the lastmap.log into to your UserLogs dir, maybe change the Map in the
file, but dont necassary its only the first map to start with.

You have now to edit the MutRandomMap.ini some examples of how the syntax is, is included or
just use the getmaps (linux only) to generate it, before using getmaps you must fit the file
to you needs, more on how to do it stands in it.
After edit copy it to your System dir, when you use the getmaps script you dont have to do that, 
the script will do ;-)

And dont foget to start the mutator ;-) when you use the start script, it is preconfigured
