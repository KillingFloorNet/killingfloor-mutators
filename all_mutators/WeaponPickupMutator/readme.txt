Tired of accidentally picking up weapons on the ground? Here's the solution.

Features:

+ Disable auto-pickup weapons only (ammo box, armor etc. is not affected)
+ Display use message for all pickup-able weapons with weapon name
+ Will not display message if player cannot carry it
+ Supports custom weapons (as soon as they subclass KFWeaponPickup)

Caveats:
- As this mutator overrides PlayerController completely, it might have compatibility issues with using other mutators.
- It doesn't swap your weapon with the one on the ground if your weight cannot support it. So you have to drop you weapon before picking up the heavy one.

Extract the .u and .ucl files and they should go under the System folder.
