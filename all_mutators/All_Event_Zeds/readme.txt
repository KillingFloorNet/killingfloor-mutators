Reupload of a mod I uploaded years ago. Steam removed the original one. I put v1 in the title cause I do want to update this mod with other small but neat features.

Made prior to TWI officially allowing players to use the event zeds, this mutator originally created by ForrestMarkX (and updated by me) allows players to pick a mutator to enable a set of seasonal zeds. Make sure your game is set to Standard zeds.

- Pick one of the 5 mutators to enable a set of event zeds.

- Return of the Halloween Sideshow zeds!

- 2010 Xmas versions zeds appear as variants! Elf Clot has 3 different skins while Scrake Frost has several!
More info on the removed 2010 version here: https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/differences-between-2010-and-2011-christmas-specimens.75103/

- Return of the unused Mixed Zeds. These were made for KFMod which is why TWI never used them. This means the Husk remains the same.

- Allow users to enable seasonal versions of the Gorefast SP, Shade & Fleshpound Chain-gunner. Will replace the original versions. (Example: The Xmas Shade will spawn in, instead of the Xmas Crawler)

- 3 optional addon mods to enhance all zeds models.
