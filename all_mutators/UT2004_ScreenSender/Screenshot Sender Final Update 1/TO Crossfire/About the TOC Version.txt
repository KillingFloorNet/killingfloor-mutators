The following differences between the normal screenshot sender version and the TO:C version exist:
- The package is named different: ClanSoundsv1h
- To add the mutator directly, you need to use the following path: ClanSoundsv1h.ClanSoundsv1h
- To add the mutator via ServerActor, you need to use the following path: ClanSoundsv1h.ScreenSenderServerActor
- The normal version of the screenshot reader isn't working in TO:C and vice versa.
- If you don't specify %GUID in the ScreenshotTemplate, it will be automatically added at the end.
- The source for the converter is missing.
